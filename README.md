# ORF-visualizer
This code was designed to help one see the possible Open Reading Frames in a given DNA sequence

### What it does
Takes in a text file containing the DNA sequence and finds the ORFs. From the NCBI record for SARS-CoV-2-viral sequence, the program compares the ORFs found and matches its' ranges with the CDS ranges. The program then ouputs the ranges that match.
